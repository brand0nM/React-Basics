# Props and Conditional Rending
## Overview
### Purpose
use props to display the relevant information and conditionally render specific elements
### Setup
After copying the projects contents to my-app's src, Move the Images folder into our Public folder. Before we were manually importing each photo to our jsx app element then Rending it to our page, but for development ease we'll store the images locally and reference based on local path.
